    title: "7 proven strategies to learn the most difficult topics!",
    description:
      "While many students give into the frustration and disappointment that comes with learning difficult topics, these 7 practical strategies will make it ridiculously easier for you. Read till the end",

    fullText: `1Ô∏è. The first step to simplifying any difficult topic is to break it down into smaller easy-to-digest chunks. Don‚Äôt attempt to take it from the top and expect to cover it all. Breaking the topics into smaller chunks gives room for you to set short term goals and there is a sense of achievement that comes as you cover these smaller sub topics which makes you more interested in going further. 
      2. Engage multiple senses by incorporating visual aids, diagrams, audio books and mnemonics into your study. The topic is hard enough already, so don‚Äôt try to learn it by using just one approach such as ‚Äúreading textbooks‚Äù alone, You will find yourself forgetting what you‚Äôve read no matter how many times you try. Instead, integrate multiple senses into your learning; visual, auditory, motor and you do this by using Video tutorials, Audio books, Flashcards, solving Past Questions etc. This activates multiple memory and learning centers of the brain and allows you understand the topic in multiple learning pathways. 
      3Ô∏è. Utilize spaced repetition techniques. When you finish a particular topic, my brother, it‚Äôs not over yet, the next day when you‚Äôre about to move on to another subtopic, ensure you revise the areas you already covered. Repetition can be hard but it‚Äôs probably the most proven ways to consolidate memory. 
      4Ô∏è. Find creative ways to apply theoretical knowledge to real-life scenarios or clinical cases. 
      5Ô∏è. Teach what you‚Äôve learnt to someone. This helps solidify your understanding through active recall. 
      6Ô∏è. Test yourself with Past Questions, Mock exams, quizzes, games etc. All these help with active recall. The more you task your brain to remember something, the more it slide into your long term memory. 
      7Ô∏è. Reward and celebrate yourself when you achieve any set goal no matter how small. This makes your brain crave more achievements.`,

    title: "Cover more grounds in your study with these 6 Time Management Tips",
    description:
      "I once asked a student what he thinks about time management, and all he could imagine was ‚Äúhow to allocate time when we study‚Äù. This is the mistake many people make; thinking Time management is only applicable to us 'when we study'.",
    fullText: `These 5 TIPS will increase your productivity by 100√ó, do SAVE for later‚úÖ 
    1Ô∏è. Learn the art of "time blocking" where you schedule out EVERY part‚Äîand I mean every part‚Äîof your day. Allocate specific periods for study, relaxation, socializing, quality time with your babe (let's say you have one) and every other activity that place in your day. Leave none out. This gives you a psychological understanding and preparation of what should be happening at every hour of your day.
    2. Find your peak productivity hours and schedule your most challenging tasks during those times. Your productivity hours should be the time you read Pharmacology, Biochemistry and other similar courses that taste like sorrow and bitterness. During your productivity hours, you're in your most mental state and alertness. Personally, my productivity hours are the few hours in the morning just before going to class. Usually 5am-7am. Yours could be in the evening, Discover it and note it down.
    3. Be true to yourself. Funmi, that ‚Äú9 hours for reading‚Äù you wrote in your timetable won't work and we both know it. Learn to space out your study period and spice it up with breaks, exercise, games, etc.
    4. Minimize distractions and stay focused during study sessions. If you have to lock up certain apps on your phone so you can have maximal focus, do it. Some mobile apps such as Screen time, AppBlock can temporary help you lock some apps during your productivity hours.
    5. Sleep at your alloted time and don't let it be shorter or longer. 6-7hrs sleep is optimal. Don't try to cut it short, you'd only render other sessions of your day not too productive. So sleep well and sleep right my dear.

    title: "Remember ALL you read 5 these study techniques",
    description:
      "You've probably heard the phrase ‚Äústudy smarter not harder‚Äù more times that you can count but do you even know what it means?",
    fullText: `For a start, whenever we study, our sole goal is to convert the short term memory gathered to long term memories. The ‚ÄúLearning Cone‚Äù emphasises that after 2 weeks, we only remember 10% of what we ‚Äúread‚Äù, 20% of what we ‚Äúhear‚Äù, 30% of what we ‚Äúsee‚Äù, 50% of what we ‚Äúsee and hear‚Äù, 70% of what we‚Äùsay‚Äù and 90% of what we ‚Äúsay and do‚Äù. üìåIf your goal is to remember ALL you study, then your focus should be on ‚ÄúSeeing‚Äù, ‚ÄúHearing‚Äù and ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù whatever read. Here are practical steps to effect thisüëáüèΩ
    1. Read a topic the same day you‚Äôre taught. Resist that urge to sleep over it. Read it that same day because the memory is still fresh and you can easily recall the events that took place during the course of the lecture.
    2. Study more than once and do it right by engaging multiple senses. Don't make the mistake of learning a topic solely by reading textbooks or boring PDFs. Instead, integrate different learning pathways such as the Visual pathways (Pictures/atlases), Auditory pathways (Audio books), AudioVisual pathways (Youtube videos). These different pathways stimulate multiple regions in the brain and in doing so consolidate memory.
    3. Task yourself with flashcards. This activates the kinesthetic pathway of consolidating memory. The action of flipping flashcards acts as a way of ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù something. Don‚Äôt forget you remember 90% of what we say and do.
    4. Challenge yourself with Quizzes and Practice Questions. The act of tasking your brain to recollect something strengthens neural link associated with that memory.
    5. Teach what you‚Äôve learnt and teach it often. Doing this helps with active recall which is fundamental for memory retention. It is one simplest way to remember what you‚Äôve learnt through the act of ‚ÄúSaying‚Äù
